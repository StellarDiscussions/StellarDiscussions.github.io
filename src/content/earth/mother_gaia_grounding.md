Since 2013, one of my favorite abilities is communicating with Mother Gaia. Mother Gaia, Earth, is the first planet I was able to channel & have an open dialogue with. Recently she requested we co-create a grounding ceremony to uplift humanity and help us stay grounded to her. Whenever you feel anxious or overwhelmed by life and want to be calmed & get centered listen to this grounding ceremony! It was created for all, but is focused on people that donâ€™t have much time to spare. This is an open invitation from Mother Gaia and me to pause, reset & go!!!

## Transcript

Welcome to Mother Gaia's grounding ceremony.

Hi, my name is Carmelina.

This grounding ceremony was requested by Mother Gaia

in an effort to uplift humanity

while keeping us grounded to her.

It was co-created through our conversations.

I will begin the ceremony by inviting Mother Gaia in

as we ground ourselves to her.

Mother Gaia, please join us during our grounding ceremony.

We welcome your presence

and thank you for joining us

and providing us comfort and love.

Now let's begin.

Sitting down somewhere comfortably

with your feet firmly placed on the ground in front of you.

Be still.

Now let's relax and intend to create a quiet place in your mind.

A place where there are no daily distractions.

A serene place where you can ground yourself to Mother Gaia.

Close your eyes

and slowly begin breathing in deeply

through your nose and slowly letting the air out from your mouth.

We'll repeat this breathing pattern eight additional

times to help you relax and let go of your thoughts.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

Breathe slowly, deeply, in from your nose and out from your mouth.

We begin your journey by breathing normal again,

with your eyes closed and visualizing a golden thread spiraling around your body.

This golden circular spiral envelops you

and begins to illuminate your body a bright gold.

Imagining your body colored bright gold

and your feet beginning to root into Mother Gaia's earth effortlessly, comfortably.

With every passing second you travel through layers further down into her.

As you continue to root deep into Mother Gaia,

you'll feel her loving golden energy radiating,

touching your bright golden roots with welcoming energy

guiding you as your roots keep growing deeper downward,

reaching her core.

You wrap your bright golden roots around it to stay firmly grounded onto her.

Remaining firmly grounded,

now focus on Mother Gaia's energy

and allow it to flow into your body,

feeling her comfort and love.

Intend that this feeling remained with you to keep you uplifted all day long.

Slowly open your eyes,

feeling securely grounded,

anchored to Mother Gaia's core.

Mother Gaia, thank you for being here with us.

Thank you for loving us.

Thank you for giving us this blessed earth.

Thank you for your comfort and security.

Mother Gaia, we love and need you.
